            A student-centered approach means placing the needs and interests of
            the students at the forefront. It involves understanding the
            individual strengths, weaknesses, and learning styles of each
            student. Administrators are committed to creating an environment
            where students feel valued and supported.

            clear learning objectives, challenging coursework, and high
            expectations for academic performance.
          </GridListItem>
          <GridListItem title="Qualified Faculty" invert>
            Schools with this commitment hire and retain well-qualified,

            certifications to deliver effective instruction.
