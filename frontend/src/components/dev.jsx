          I'm <strong>Manish Tamang</strong>, a 16-year-old from Kathmandu,
          Nepal, with a fervent passion for web development. My journey in the
          world of coding began at a young age, and I've immersed myself in
          creating captivating websites using React, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS.
          My ambition is to evolve into a full-stack developer, adept at both
          front-end and back-end development, enabling me to craft powerful and
          versatile web applications. With every project, I'm honing my skills
          and knowledge, eager to embrace the dynamic landscape of technology
          and make a meaningful impact.

            This website
          </strong>{" "}
          has been entirely created from scratch, with my sincere appreciation
          for the guidance and assistance I received from various online
          tutorials, the invaluable support from ChatGPT, and the endless help
          from the Stack Overflow community. I'd also like to extend my
          heartfelt thanks to <strong>Mr. Millan Kumar Sunuwar</strong>, our computer teacher, whose
          sponsorship of the web hosting and domain made this project possible.
          His encouragement was the driving force behind completing this project
          within a tight timeframe. Once again, thank you, Millan Sir, and to
          all those who have consistently believed in and supported me.
